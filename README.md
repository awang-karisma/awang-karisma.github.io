# My Personal Profile

Still WIP
Actually I wanted to have my own profile page since god knows how long it was, but now finally I have the resolve to do and just create it, mainly because I am currently enrolled in an online class, Digitalent by Kominfo. I took Golang course, and it's when the mentor explained about git that I have the thought "that's it I'm gonna create my own Github Pages" as a challenge for myself.

In the near future, I'll also create a blog in Github Pages, but using Sveltekit and such. Kinda challenge also for myself.
